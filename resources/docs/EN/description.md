## [About](/{{route}}/{{version}}/description#about)
RescueApp is a helpful tool that enables users to effectively manage, coordinate, and document search operations. It includes various analysis tools and decision-making support, allowing multiple users with different levels of access to work together on the same search simultaneously based on their profile. Moreover, RescueApp allows for the simultaneous handling of multiple active searches, regardless of their location within the territory. This feature maximizes efficiency and productivity, particularly in emergencies where time is of the essence. Overall, RescueApp is an invaluable asset for anyone involved in search operations, as it facilitates efficient collaboration and effective resource allocation.

As a considerable amount of the data that the application processes is geospatial, the inclusion of GIS tools is an essential component. Additionally, the application's ability to visualize the data on the map means that much of the data generated is accurately represented, making it easier for users to understand the information and make informed decisions.

- **Organising**: The application allows users to access all necessary tools from a single web platform, which greatly simplifies the workflow methodology. The ability to work simultaneously from different locations enables real-time sharing of information among all team members. The application's browser-based nature also makes it highly accessible, requiring only an internet connection and a web browser, which allows users to access it from any device.

- **Coordination**: The application enables users to manage and track all resources allocated to a service in real time, using the mapping tools. It provides users with the ability to plan tasks, supervise them, and record them once completed.

- **Documentation**:  All information entered into the application is stored in a database, which allows users to access and consult any previous services. The application also enables users to generate paper reports of data, completed tasks,  and generated maps.

- **Analysis**: The application offers two analysis tools to facilitate more effective search and rescue operations. The first tool is a dynamic vulnerability table generated based on the descriptive data of individuals. This table allows for a more tailored response to each unique situation. The second analysis tool is the generation of behavioral patterns from the profiles of missing individuals. These patterns are continually updated as new services are incorporated, enabling users to obtain the most up-to-date information possible.

## [Who is it for?](/{{route}}/{{version}}/description#for)
The target audience for the application is primarily emergency services and individuals responsible for coordinating and organizing search and rescue operations for missing persons.

## [Does it work for any type of search?](/{{route}}/{{version}}/description#useful)
For simple searches, the data collection and search closure tools can be utilized. However, all information gathered will be saved to the application's database, where it can be utilized for analysis and potentially useful for future services.
For more complex search and rescue operations, the mapping and task tracking tools are much more beneficial, as they enable the organization and coordination of a large number of team members.
